Visibility. That's the problem.

Security Information and Event Management, or SIEM, is a comprehensive system that provides real-time analysis of security alerts. This is an essential tool for security operation centers (SOC), whereby data generated by endpoints can be collected, aggregated, and analyzed. In this post, we will talk about <a href="https://wazuh.com/">Wazuh</a> and my experiences in installing it.

Why Wazuh? Primarily, it's open-source. Second, the ease of installation. Lastly, the name has a cool ring to it—sounds like something you'll hear on a kids movie.

Now that's visibility! Just like how Wazuh is able to see endpoint alerts, and the user can see into its <a href="https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh">code</a>.
